# About
This is a "Honkai: Star Rail" version of tic-tac-toe, featuring first three maps in the "Star Rail" game and beautiful music along with them. One play would play trailblazer(male), the main character in the "Star Rail" game and the other player would paly the role of kafka, who is a member of Stellaron Hunters as one of major dark forces.
